This is my little shopping list app

Started in Sep-2025, while I was trying to move away from Google.

The system consists of a front-end that runs in a browser, desktop or mobile,
and a back-end that is a perl cgi script.  It can do three things:
  GET .../shopping/    - Get a list of available JSON files
  GET .../shopping/api.cgi/shop  - return the contents of shop.json for the current user
  POST .../shopping/api.cgi/shop - create or update the shop.json file
The back-end also serves static files line index.html, shopping.js and .css, etc

Here is a canonical example of the json:

{
  "items": [
    { "type": "section", "title": "Meats", "collapsed": false, "items": [
      { "type": "item", "text": "Bacon", "checked": false },
      { "type": "item", "text": "Steak", "checked": true }
    ]},
    { "type": "section", "title": "Vegetables", "collapsed": true, "items": [
      { "type": "item", "text": "Carrots", "checked": true },
      { "type": "text", "text": "Remember to check the special offers" }
    ]}
  ]
}

There will be more fields later, for example dates when created and modified.


The UI consists of a top line with the name of the list we are working with,
and a pull-down menu with options to add a new list, delete this one, and the
same operations as in a section menu.

The main body of the UI consists of (nested) sections that contains lines. Most
have a checkbox on them, some can be plain text. Each section head will have
a pulldown menu with options for (un)checking all items in it,  for adding new
items, for filtering the display to show only checked or unchecked items, etc.

The item lines have (a optional) checkbox, some text, and a pulldown menu with
options for deleting the item, adding a new one, or duplicating this one.

Clicking on any text (section title or item text) allows editing it.

After inserting a new item, the UI continues to insert a new one, unless the
text is empty.

Any changes made in the UI should be autosaved to back-end after a few seconds.
